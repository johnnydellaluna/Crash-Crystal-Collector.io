# Crash's Crystal Collector

This is a fun game starring everyone's favorite marsupial, Crash Bandicoot! Dr. Cortex is using crystals in order to power his latest machine to take over the world. It's up to you and Crash to prevent that from happening.

To win the game, you must match the target score on screen. This is done by selecting the crystals that appear on each page. Each crystal is assigned a certain value, which only appears when you click on them. Once you match the target score or go over, it's game over. Each crystal is given a different value when the game begins.

This game has been designed using Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstap HTML and CSS designs. All character references and images are copyrighted by Sony and Naughty Dog, the game developers responsible for the original Crash Bandicoot.
